PDFMiner is a python based package that is used to extract only PDF files.
It can also convert PDF files into other file formats like HTML/XML.
This library provides its response form of an API request. 
That's why this package takes slightly time other than other purely python-based packages.
CODE : 

from pdfminer.pdfinterp import PDFResourceManager, PDFPageInterpreter  
from pdfminer.converter import TextConverter  
from pdfminer.layout import LAParams  
from pdfminer.pdfpage import PDFPage  
from io import StringIO  

def pdf_to_text(path):  
    res_manager = PDFResourceManager()  
    ret_str = StringIO()  
    codec = 'utf-8'  
    laparams = LAParams()  
    device = TextConverter(res_manager, ret_str, codec=codec, laparams=laparams)  
    fp = open(path, 'rb')  
    interpreter = PDFPageInterpreter(res_manager, device)  
    password = ""  
    maxpages = 0  
    caching = True  
    pagenos = set()  
    for page in PDFPage.get_pages(fp, pagenos, maxpages=maxpages, password=password, caching=caching, check_extractable=True):  
        interpreter.process_page(page)  
    text = ret_str.getvalue()  
    fp.close()  
    device.close()  
    ret_str.close()  
    return text  

# Path to the PDF file
path = r"C:\Users\ELCOT\Downloads\19225-UNIT 3-notes.pdf"  

# Extract text using PDFMiner
pdf_miner_text = pdf_to_text(path)

# Save the extracted text to a text file
output_path = r"C:\Users\ELCOT\Downloads\output_text.txt"
with open(output_path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as text_file:
    text_file.write(pdf_miner_text)

print(f"Text successfully extracted and saved to {output_path}")

This code will extract the text from the provided PDF using PDFMiner and then save the extracted text into a ".txt" file.
