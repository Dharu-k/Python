PyPDF2 is a complete Python package that can be used to perform the many types of PDF operations. We can use this module to perform the following tasks.

We can extract information from a PDF in Python.
We can rotate pages.
We can merge two or more PDFs.
We can split the PDFs.
We can add watermarks.
We can encrypt a PDF.

CODE : 

import PyPDF2  
# Path to the PDF file
path = r"C:\Users\ELCOT\Downloads\19225-UNIT 3-notes.pdf"  
try:
    # Open the PDF file in read-binary mode
    with open(path, 'rb') as pdfFileObj:
        # Create a PDF reader object
        pdfReader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(pdfFileObj)
        
        # Print the number of pages in the PDF
        print(f"Number of pages: {len(pdfReader.pages)}")
        
        # Extract text from all pages
        pypdf2_text = ''
        for page in pdfReader.pages:
            pypdf2_text += page.extract_text()
    # Save the extracted text to a file
    output_path = r"C:\Users\ELCOT\Downloads\output_text.txt"
    with open(output_path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as text_file:
        text_file.write(pypdf2_text) 
    print(f"Text successfully extracted to {output_path}")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("The specified PDF file was not found.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
 

The above code prints the number of pages in the pdf. We can also extract the information.
