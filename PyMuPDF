PyMuPDF is a Python binding for MuPDF, a lightweight PDF viewer.
With PyMuPDF, we can access files with extensions like *.pdf, *.xps, *.oxps, *.epub, *.cbz or *.fb2 from your Python scripts.
Several popular image formats are supported as well.

CODE : 

import fitz  # PyMuPDF

# Path to the PDF file
path = r"C:\Users\ELCOT\Downloads\19225-UNIT 3-notes.pdf"

try:
    # Open the PDF file using PyMuPDF
    with fitz.open(path) as doc:
        # Extract text from all pages
        pymupdf_text = ''
        for page in doc:
            pymupdf_text += page.get_text()

    # Save the extracted text to a file
    output_path = r"C:\Users\ELCOT\Downloads\output_text.txt"
    with open(output_path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as text_file:
        text_file.write(pymupdf_text)

    print(f"Text successfully extracted to {output_path}")

except FileNotFoundError:
    print("The specified PDF file was not found.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")


The above code eliminates the Extra indentation and line breaks.
